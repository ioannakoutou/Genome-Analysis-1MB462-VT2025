## Genome Analysis – 1MB462 – VT2025

This independent course project is part of the **Genome Analysis (1MB462)** course at Uppsala University, conducted during the Spring semester of 2025.

The goal of this project is to explore and partially reproduce key analyses from the article "Chromosome-level genome assembly of Niphotrichum japonicum provides new insights into heat stress responses in mosses" by [Zhou et al. (2023)](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/plant-science/articles/10.3389/fpls.2023.1271357/full). Utilizing the data and general methodology presented in the article, this project aims to reanalyze selected parts of the original pipeline. The entire process will be adapted to the project's scope and documented throughout this GitHub wiki.
